I ran into a windows update issue on 2019 servers that I could not get fixed. I found this script https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Reset-WindowsUpdate/1.20 
however it's outdated looks like its for Windows 7,8,2012.

I found the info needed to update this script here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/windows-update-resources
So this updated version now supports Windows 10,11,2016,2019.
